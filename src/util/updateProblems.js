// TODO: Get information from the config file and generate files if a file does not exist already for it.
// Need to make a function to get a parsed and prettified name of the file based on the name of the problem. Somehow, this has to be futureproof. Maybe could also work by just using the index of the problem.
// Yeah, just use the index of the problem to generate the file name like "problem-1.py", etc.
// Then, insert into the files a commented out preface with the question text, and a preformatted python standard function which outputs in the correct format.
// I think that I want to get the last standard output from the program to be taken as the answer.
